# Instructions to Push Code to GitHub

The code has been committed locally and is ready to push to your GitHub repository.

## Option 1: Using GitHub Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate a new token with `repo` scope
3. Run these commands in the terminal:

```bash
cd /home/code/spendsense-ai
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/HarshTambade/SpendSense-AI.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `YOUR_TOKEN` with your personal access token.

## Option 2: Using SSH (If you have SSH keys set up)

```bash
cd /home/code/spendsense-ai
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:HarshTambade/SpendSense-AI.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: Manual Push from Your Local Machine

1. Clone the repository on your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarshTambade/SpendSense-AI.git
cd SpendSense-AI
```

2. Copy all files from this project to your local clone
3. Commit and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: SpendSense AI MVP"
git push origin main
```
